# CUDA Neural Network

There were three purposes for this project. The first was to explore CUDA programming.
The second was to create a neural network without the uses of any major libraries. 
The last reason was to get familiar with C++ programming. 

# Software System requirements

The project is split into two sections. The first section performs linear algebra computations
required for the neural network, sequentially and utilizes the CPU. The code for it can be found 
in the [CPUNeuralNetwork folder](CPUNeuralNetwork). 
The second performs linear algebra computations required for the neural network in parallel 
and utilizes the GPU. The code for it can be found in the [GPUNeuralNetwork folder](GPUNeuralNetwork).

## Sequential computation

For the CPU portion of this project, you will need a C++ compiler.
I used visual studio code with g++ compiler.
 You can follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)
 to setup the g++ compiler.

 In order to run the CPU portion of this project, from the command prompt
 move into the [CPUNeuralNetwork folder](CPUNeuralNetwork) and compile it using the following command.
 ```
 g++ main.cpp .\Testing\NeuralNetTesting.cpp .\Testing\DatasetTesting.cpp CPUNeuralNetwork.cpp Layers/HiddenLayer.cpp Layers/OutputLayer.cpp Dataset.cpp Matrices/Matrix.cpp Matrices/Vector.cpp -o main
 ```

 Then run the code using the following command.
 ```
 ./main
 ```

## Parallel computation

However, for the GPU portion of this project, you will need to have the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and a [Nvidia GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/).

Make sure to download the CUDA version compatible with your GPU capability.

If you have a Nvidia GPU device, you can run [specs.cu file](GPUNeuralNetwork/Specs/specs.cu) by
uncommenting out `gpu::getGPUSpecs();` code line in the [main.cu file](GPUNeuralNetwork/main.cu). The 
GPU device specifications for my system is the following.
```
CUDA version:   v10000
Driver: 11070 Runtime: 10000

This PC has 1 GPU(s)

GPU # 0 : NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M: 5.0
  Global memory:   2047mb
  Block registers: 65536

  Warp size:         32
  Threads per block: 1024
  Max block dimensions: [ 1024, 1024, 64 ]
  Max grid dimensions:  [ 2147483647, 65535, 65535 ]

Number of SMs: 5
```

After installing the CUDA toolkit, you will have access to [nvcc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_CUDA_Compiler). However, if you want to use Microsoft Visual Studios, make sure
to have it installed before installing the CUDA toolkit. Furthermore, make sure 
the Microsoft Visual Studio version is compatible with the CUDA version you installed.

 Run `nvcc --version` from the command prompt to get information about 
the nvcc version you have installed. I have the following version installed. 
```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2018 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Sat_Aug_25_21:08:04_Central_Daylight_Time_2018
Cuda compilation tools, release 10.0, V10.0.130
```

CUDA does not support g++ on windows. You will need `cl.exe` that comes with 2015 Microsoft Visual Studios.
If you do not have 2015 Microsoft Visual Studios installed, install the 2015 Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools.
Locate the path to the `cl.exe` file and add it to your environment variables.

Once all of the above is setup,  from the command prompt move into  [GPUNeuralNetwork folder](GPUNeuralNetwork)
and uncomment the section of the code you want to run in the [main.cu file](GPUNeuralNetwork/main.cu).
First compile the code using the follow command.
```
nvcc -lcurand main.cu .\ErrorHandling\CudaError.cu .\Testing\NeuralNetTesting.cpp .\Specs\specs.cu .\Testing\DatasetTesting.cpp .\Testing\MatrixTesting.cpp .\Testing\VectorTesting.cpp .\Testing\ScalarTesting.cpp  NeuralNetwork.cpp Layers/HiddenLayer.cu Layers/OutputLayer.cpp Dataset.cpp Matrix/Matrix.cu Matrix/Vector.cu Matrix/Scalar.cu -o main
```
Then run the code using the following command.
```
./main
```
